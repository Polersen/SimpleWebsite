# SimpleWebsite
 A simple portfolio website

This is a simple portfolio portal created with html, css and javascript about me and some of my personal projects. However I want to replace this site with a similar one created using React.js.

Right now there are only a few of my prior projects from school that I am trying to optimize and make more user friendly.

Currently in progress:
* Populate index.html with necessary information.
* Add links to github repositories.
* Publish website with Github Pages.
* Add navigation bar for different sections.
* Make selecting different sections with navbar seamless so it doesn't reload the page (use Ajax).
