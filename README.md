# SimpleWebsite
 A simple portfolio website

This is a simple portfolio portal created with html, css and javascript about me and some of my personal projects. However I want to replace this site with a similar one created using React.js.

Right now there are only a few of my prior projects from school that I am trying to optimize and make more user friendly.

Currently in progress:
* Populate index.html with necessary information. -Done
* Add links to github repositories. -Done
* Publish website with Github Pages. -Done
* Add navigation bar for different sections.
* Make selecting different sections with navbar seamless, so it doesn't reload the page (use Ajax).
* Add animations or transitions for a smoother experiences where it fits.
* Add a personal favicon. -Done
* Add cards for the projects.
* Add carousel with images of code and ui from the projects.
* Update index.html and make it look modern and attractive.
* Create a layout file.
